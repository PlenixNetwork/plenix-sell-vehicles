# 🚗 Plenix FiveM Sell Vehicles

**Plenix FiveM Sell Vehicles** is a lightweight FiveM script designed to replace the old `esx-qalle-sellvehicles`.  
It’s inspired by the original but takes a fresh approach to how vehicles are displayed and sold.

## 🕹️ Usage

Go to any Sell Zone and interact (target prompt or marker) to open the selling/buying UI.

- **List Vehicle:** Select a nearby owned vehicle and set a price within limits.  
- **Buy Vehicle:** Browse listings at the zone, preview details, and purchase.

On successful sale:
- Seller receives `price - commission`.  
- Ownership transfers to the buyer (ESX `owned_vehicles` updated).  
- Listing is removed.

Tip: If `Config.UseTarget = false`, markers/text UI will appear instead of target.
